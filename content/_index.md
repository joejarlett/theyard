title: "Welcome to the Yard"

The Yard is a community-led, self-build housing initiative that grew from the local community who bought the ex-scaffolding yard and sold plots to self-builders thereby rescuing the site from commercial developers (see [Backstory](/backstory)). We created this website initially for residents to keep up with Yard business but itâ€™s grown to provide information about The Yard and the local neighbourhood for our neighbours and for the general public.

We would like to it be actively useful to the local community so please send in events, community groups and other ideas [here](/contact)
