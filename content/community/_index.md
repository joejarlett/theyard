The Yard nestles in Ashley Vale with some great neighbours. As you come through the painted tunnel on Mina Road, [The St Werburghs City farm](/community/st-werburghs-city-farm/) is on our doorstep, with the [City Farm Café](https://www.swcityfarm.co.uk/city-farm/the-farm-cafe/) next door. [Allotments](/community/ashley-vale-allotments/) stretch from Ashley Down Road right up to Muller Road. On the other side of the valley is the [Narroways Nature Reserve](/community/narroways-nature-reserve/). Passing through the second tunnel to the north east you reach [Purple Patch](/community/purple-patch/), a small holding which offers veg boxes and salads, and walking on (crossing Muller Road) you climb up to [Purdown](https://www.facebook.com/groups/friendsofsouthpurdown/) – an extensive and interesting open area.

On site we have a community hall - [Wild Goose Space](/community/wild-goose-space/) - bookable by residents and non residents alike and a fortnightly? visit from the [Oat Float](/community/oat-float/) (zero waste food from an electric float).

Find information on all these below plus Ashley Vale Action Group (AVAG), Ecomotive, Neighbourhood Watch and Sims Hall Shared Harvest
