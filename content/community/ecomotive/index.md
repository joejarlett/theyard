Ecomotive is a workers’ co-operative which grew out of the 40-home Ashley Vale eco self build project in Bristol.

Our name (Eco = from the Greek root of ‘home’; Motive = ‘reason for action’) symbolises the way in which we take action to create opportunities for more sustainable homes, and empower others to do the same. Since the mid-2000&#39;s we have grown and evolved, building up a strong core team supported by a collective of professional associates and volunteers.

Ecomotive operates in many different spheres, from the grassroots through to the national policy arena. You might equally see us giving a presentation at a housing conference or a spontaneous radio interview on the stage of a music festival. We provide master-planning, business planning and other types of technical consultancy services to communities, businesses and public sector customers, while also retaining the flexibility to provide 1:1 advice and mentoring to individuals and small groups trying to get their ideas off the ground. We are passionate about what we do and are willing to go the extra mile in order to bring quality to every area of our work. We especially love to get hands-on, and our new pop-up SNUG modular home build space in Lockleaze is enabling us to pilot a new community-involved model of housebuilding while also giving local people the opportunity to join our volunteer training programme, make new friends and learn new skills together. Our ethos is to be creative, flexible and solution-focused and we enjoy taking on a challenge!
