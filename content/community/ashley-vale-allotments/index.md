The Farm manages 13 acres of community allotments (formerly known as Ashley Vale Allotment Association) that surround the Farm site. It is bounded by Stony Lane, Ashley Hill and the railway line on the side of Gaunt Lane. (Please note: the allotment site on the north side of Stony Lane is managed separately by Bristol City Council.)

With a common theme of connecting people to food, nature and their community, the Farm views the Allotment site as an important asset for the local community, including plot holders, local residents and wildlife.

AVAA Allotments forms part of a green lung which links the heart of Bristol with its northern outskirts creating a series of safe creature corridors, providing a home for wildlife, generating tonnes of local food for plot holders and of course, presents a wonderful view for all that pass its boundaries.

There is currently a waiting list which is 6 years long! To join the waiting list fill out a form on the Farmâ€™s web site: https://www.swcityfarm.co.uk/city-farm/avaa-allotments/

There is however currently a proposal for a community plot: https://www.swcityfarm.co.uk/city-farm/avaa-allotments/proposal-for-community-plot/
