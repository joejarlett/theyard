Narroways Hill is a little grassy & wooded ridge dissected by railway lines lying just North of inner-city Bristol, in the neighbourhood of St Werburghs.

In 1997 local folk campaigned to save open land at Narroways Junction from development.
The area became an official nature reserve-a green oasis that will be valued for generations
to come. It became a Millennium Green in the year 2000, with a 999-year lease to keep it
free and open to the local people and allow wildlife to thrive. On 12th January 2016
Narroways Millennium Green finally became an [official Local Nature Reserve (LNR)](https://narroways.wordpress.com/2016/01/31/narroways-is-now-officially-a-local-nature-reserve/).

Nowadays, the site is looked after by Narroways Millennium Green Trust, the charity set up
to administer and manage the site now that it has Millennium Green status. All the work
needed to maintain the site and keep it available to be enjoyed by the local community (and
wildlife!) is carried out by a small group of volunteers and enthusiasts. They always welcome
new members, and volunteers for one of their regular workdays.
