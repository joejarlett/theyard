Join Sims Hill to enjoy your share of the harvest! Sims Hill Shared Harvest is a pioneering social enterprise growing food for the people of Bristol just four miles from the city centre.

We are a community supported agriculture scheme (CSA), which means we are a partnership between growers and consumers. On our sites we use natural growing methods and permaculture principles to produce high quality vegetables and support innovating social action through land-based projects. Sims Hill is a cooperative, owned and run by our members.

Similar to a box scheme, but as it’s a co-operative you own a share of the project and can be as involved as you like in the running of it and associated community events. In return you get a weekly veg box, but also share the risks and satisfactions of urban farming. It’s part of a network of local food projects that include the Severn Project, Feed Bristol, and lots of community gardens and allotments.
