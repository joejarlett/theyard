St Werburghs City Farm has been connecting people to land, nature and food since 1980.

It is a wonderful community resource accessible to all, spread over four sites. There is a two-acre animal small holding, a community garden, ancient woodlands and orchards, and 13 acres of community allotments. The Farm has developed a number of successful programmes to engage with the wider community including Bristol’s most disadvantaged residents. Providing work experience, volunteer opportunities, training placements, play opportunities, family activities, community events, tailored educational trips, an award winning café, a playground and a free, open-access site, it is much more than just a Farm.
