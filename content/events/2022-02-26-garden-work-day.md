Yes it's that time again - but this year we can have a proper workday on Saturday the 26th February.

We will be buying in the usual huge mound of mulch to spread around the Yard communal garden (and probably some of your own gardens- there's always too much).

There will also be some pruning and feeding of plant pots to do. So please come along and be involved to help make the garden beautiful this summer.

We will start at 10 am and go on until we are finished or run out of steam (usually about 2 or 3pm) so  please drop in at any point .

Please bring shovels, spades, secateurs and wheelbarrows.
