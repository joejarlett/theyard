We're going to try again and hold a work day on Saturday 22nd May 10am  to 'as long as it last's (mid-afternoon?). 

There will be a mix of tasks , some gardening, some construction. It's an opportunity for a socially distanced social while doing some improvements around the garden! Put it in your diaries and I'll remind you nearer the time.
