In 1999 The Yard was a disused scaffolding yard up for sale for development. A
commercial developer had planned to build a typical housing estate on it. A group of
neighbours formed Ashley Vale Action Group (AVAG) to protest these plans. It was a
unique neighbourhood, and people didnâ€™t want an identikit housing development built
solely to profit a development company. The group successfully stopped the plans, and
then decided to develop the site themselves with plots for self-build houses, and
communal gardens, workshops and a community room for the neighbourhood. The Yard
is the result of the passion and determination of many people; those original visionaries
who believed that a community-led development could work, and the self-builders and
neighbours who made it happen.

If you want to know more there is a book, _The Story of the Yard; Building a Community_ by
Carrie Hitchcock, available from the St Werburghs branch of the Better Food Company.
