Hi, as we get closer to winter, the number of rats in the Yard will increase. They come here for food, water and shelter, and that is all growing scarcer on the surrounding allotments. Could we put out a reminder on the Website for people in the Yard to take especial care with their bird food at this time of year, so as not to encourage the rats. It might also be a good time to remind people of the helpful leaflet we put out last year.
Thanks, Trish
