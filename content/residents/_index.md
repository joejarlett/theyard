The Yard is a community-led, self-build housing initiative [(see Backstory)](/backstory/). It was established on principles of community and sustainability [(see Handbook)](/residents/handbook/) which still inform how we live here.

The Yard is managed by The Mina Road (Bristol) Estate Management Company Ltd. (The EMC) that manages the collectively owned areas of the estate. All property owners on the estate signed a contract at point of sale agreeing to be a Member of this Company, and to pay service charges towards the maintenance and development of site infrastructure and communal gardens. The following documents explain decision making structures and your rights and responsibilities as a Member. Two of our most important covenants are: 

- No cats because we back onto the nature reserve
- No more cars than will fit on your property - which means we can have a shared garden instead of a car park

Company Directors are elected by Members annually at our AGM or co-opted during the year. Company administrator is Carrie Hitchcock, e.m.c.yard@gmail.com. Please contact Carrie with any queries, concerns, suggestions, and items for meeting agendas. We have regular, advertised open meetings and welcome new directors and any residents who want to be involved in developing and maintaining this community.
