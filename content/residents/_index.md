The Yard is a community-led, self-build housing initiative that grew from the original self-builders who, buying plots before there was planning permission, rescued the site from developers [(see Backstory)](/backstory/). It was established on principles of community and sustainability [(see Handbook)](/residents/handbook/) which still inform how we live here.

There is an Estate Management Committee (EMC) with a group of directors [(see EMC handbook)](/residents/handbook/#personnel) - property owners pay a small monthly fee - and decisions are made in regular meetings [(see meetings and decision making)](/residents/#meeting-minutes). Newcomers and long term residents are all encouraged to be part of the [management and decision making process](/residents/#meeetings-and-decision-making). There are things that we sign up to (eg no cats because we back onto the nature reserve and no more cars than will fit on your property - which means we can have a shared garden instead of a car park. [(see Handbook](/residents/handbook/). Articles- (/residents/#articles-of-association) and TP1 which lay everything out.)

Before COVID we had regular ‘feasts’ in the [Wild Goose Space](/community/wild-goose-space/), picnics on the green, carols and a bonfire night – we plan to re-start these events soon.
