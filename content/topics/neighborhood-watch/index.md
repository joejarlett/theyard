## Incidents advice from Avon and Somerset police

- encouragement to report all incidents via 101 or www.avonandsomerset.police.Uk/report/crime-or-incident (even if they don’t meet the bar for criminal behaviour). These are recorded on a ‘heat map’ and allow the services to bid for extra resources. No need to have crime reference numbers or link it to other offences as that is all done by location and the comms team.
- general advice to keep safe, avoid conflict with them (as it is possible they may be armed) and a suggestion that for now walking in pairs maybe safer particularly along the cycle track.
